The following article will take you through the steps required to properly configure your Office 365 Exchange Online mailbox for use with the Outlook for Android mobile application.

Opting to use the Outlook for Android mobile application in conjunction with your Office 365 Exchange Online mailbox will allow you to take advantage of certain features when compared to use with native mail applications - for example, you can access all of your calendar information without leaving the application, as well as the contacts associated with your mailbox.

### Preparing your device

Ensure that you have the Outlook for Android mobile application installed on your mobile device - you can do this by going to the 'Play Store' in your phone's application list, and then by searching for 'Microsoft Outlook' - once installed, you are ready to configure your Office 365 Exchange Online mailbox within the application.

### Setting up your Office 365 Exchange Online Mailbox within the Outlook for Android Mobile Application - Configuring the Outlook application for the first time

Use the following steps to setup your Office 365 mailbox within the Outlook for Android mobile application:

1.	After installing and opening the Outlook mobile application, tap **Get Started** when prompted to begin.

2.	Next, enter your Office 365 email address into the field provided, and then hit **Continue**.

3.	Within the password field provided for your Office 365 account, enter your credentials and then select **Sign In** to proceed.

4.	Once logged in successfully, you will be prompted to either **Add Another Account** if you so desire, or you can simply select **Maybe Later** to complete the setup process - the application will then open into the 'Inbox' for the mailbox which you have just added.

### Setting up your Office 365 Exchange Online Mailbox in a pre-existing installation of the Outlook Mobile Application

Use the following steps to setup your Office 365 mailbox if you have already configured additional mailboxes for use within the Outlook for Android mobile application:

1.	If you already have the Outlook mobile application installed on your Android device, you can simply open the application, and then tap the icon in the upper left-hand corner to display the fly-out menu.

2.	Once the fly-out menu is opened (you should see the folders for any other mailboxes which have been added previously), tap the settings cogwheel in the bottom left corner, and then select **Add Account**.

3.	Next, select **Add an Email Account** when prompted, then enter your Office 365 email address into the provided field and tap **Continue**.

4.  After pressing **Continue**, you will be prompted to select which type of Microsoft account you are adding - select **Office 365** to proceed to the next step.

5.  After selecting **Office 365**, you will then be prompted for the password associated with the mailbox that you are attempting to add. Enter the credentials in the field provided, and then select **Sign in**.

6.  Once signed in successfully, the Office 365 mailbox will then appear in the list under any previously added mailboxes in the **Settings** menu. After this, you can simply back out of the settings, and the newly added Office 365 mailbox will be available for selection in the fly-out menu, along with any other mailboxes that were configured beforehand.

### Helpful tips when using the Outlook for Android mobile application

Reference the following information for general tips and recommendations when setting up your Office 365 mailbox within the Outlook for Android mobile application:

1.  If you are unsure of whether you have the correct password or not, you can test your credentials by attempting to sign in via portal.office.com.

2.  When attempting to configure an Office 365 user that has multi-factor authentication enabled, the Outlook Mobile Application will simply ask you for the default MFA verification method to proceed when signing in - it is not necessary to generate an app password for use with the Outlook Mobile Application.

3.  To access folders other than the 'Inbox', tap the icon in the top left corner of the Outlook application which is associated with your 365 user (when looking at the 'Inbox') - you will be presented with a fly-out menu that will display each of your existing mail folders, and you can simply tap one to view the contents within.

4.  To access the calendar data for your Office 365 mailbox, simply tap the calendar icon in the bottom-right corner of the Outlook application. Similarly, selecting the magnifying glass icon to the left of it will allow you to search things like contacts, files, etc... that are associated with your mailbox.

5.  When attempting to **Sign in**, you may encounter the error "Login Error - The connection to your mail server timed out. Please check your mail settings" - while this can be caused by network connectivity issues, this can also be caused when attempting to sign in with an unlicensed Office 365 account. If in doubt, you can reach out to your administrator to confirm which licenses have been applied to your account.
