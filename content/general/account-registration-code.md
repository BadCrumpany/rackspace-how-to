Rackspace uses an _account registration code_ to verify new users on an
account, much like two-factor authentication. If you get a new account, a
Racker creates you as a user inside the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel. When
that occurs, you receive an email notification that walks you through how to
log in to the Cloud Control Panel for the first time. This is the only time
that you need the registration code, unless you forget your user name.

The Primary contact on the account is the only person who can change this
code. When they add a new user, that new user receives a registration code.
The Primary must give the individual their code.

If you are the Primary contact on the account and you forget the code and need
to reset your login, contact your account manager.
