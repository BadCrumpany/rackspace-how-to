This is the code that is used to verify new users to an account, much like a two factor authentication login. If you get a new account, a Racker will create you a user inside the Control Panel. Once that is completed you will get a email walking you through how to login for the fist time, this is the only time you will need the Registration Code, unless you forget your user name.

The Primary on the account is the only one that can change this code, when they add a new user that new user will receive a registration code, the primary will need to give the individual their code.

If you are the primary on the account and you forget the code and need to reset your login just reach out to your account manager and we will be glad to help.
