Rackspace uses an _account registration code_ to verify new users on an
account, much like two-factor authentication. If an account administrator 
adds you as a new user, an account registration code is generated for 
your new user account and you receive an email notification that 
walks you through how to log in to the 
[Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com) for the first time. 
This is the only time that you need the registration code, 
unless you forget your user name.

The Primary contact on the account is the only person who can change this
code. When they add a new user, that new user receives a registration code.
The Primary must give the individual their code.

If you are the Primary contact on the account and you forget the code and need
to reset your login, contact your Account Manager or Rackspace Support.
