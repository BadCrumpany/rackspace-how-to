This article provides instructions for reissuing or revoking and replacing Rackspace Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates by using the Rackspace Control Panel. 

### Reissue or revoke and replace an SSL certificate. 

1. Log in to [my.rackspace.com](https://my.rackspace.com).

2. Expand the **Network** dropdown menu, then click the **SSL certificates** option.

3. Under the **Configured** tab, select the blue highlighted domain name for which you want to update the SSL certificate.

4. Select **Reissue** or **Revoke & Replace** on the right-hand side of the screen.

    - Symantec&reg; certificates prompt with the option to **Revoke and Replace** the certificate. 

        **NOTE:** Your SSL certificate is not automatically revoked on your server. The current SSL certificate remains valid until the new certificate is placed on the intended device.

    - Thawte&reg; certificates prompt with the option to **Reissue** the certificate. 

5. Click **Submit** to begin the reissue process.
