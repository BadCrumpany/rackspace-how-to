1. Log in to [my.rackspace.com](https://my.rackspace.com).

2. Select the **Network** dropdown, then click the **SSL certificates** option.

3. Under the **Configured** tab, select the blue highlighted domain name for which you want to update the Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) certificate.

4. Select **Reissue** or **Revoke & Replace** on the right-hand side of the screen.

    **NOTE:** Your SSL certificate will not be automatically revoked. The current SSL certificate will remain valid until the new certificate is placed on the intended device.
