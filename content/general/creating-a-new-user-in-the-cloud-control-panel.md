Creating a new user is easy, and can be done completely from your control panel. navigate to the control panel at mycloud.rackpace.com. Then, under the account drop down menu, choose “User Management.” At this point you’ll see all of the current users you have, and the option to add additional users. Click on “Create User.”

From here, you need to complete 4 quick sections to set up the user and determine their level of access.

### Login Details

This is where we see the credentials that the user will need to access the control panel. The username will need to be unique across all accounts, so a common “firstname.lastname” username might not be available. The password needs to be at least 8 characters with a minimum of 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 numeral. You will also need to create a security question. I recommend using a security question that cannot be guessed or Googled. Both the password and security question can be modified by the user after the account has been created. It is your responsibility to convey the password and security question to the user.

**Tip:** Instead of making your favorite color “Aquamarine,” (something that someone could guess) make it “25 mph” (The estimated average cruising airspeed of an unladen European Swallow)

### Product Access

Here you will need to choose which products and services this particular user will need access to. For most trusted administrators you will likely want to provide “Full Access.” Others will need to have custom access on a per-product basis. There are several different configuration options available for each user, so figuring out which combination can be a bit difficult. You can read more about Role Based Access Control in our Knowledge Center, or contact your account management team for more information. 

### Account Access

This section gives permission to a user to receive invoices and interact with our Billing Support Teams, and to cancel an account. Most users will not need this access.

### Contact Information

Finally, we need to know how to contact the user for support. We won’t use this information to send marketing materials, but we occasionally need to contact a technical or administrative user to troubleshoot issues. A current phone number and email address will help us to expedite that process.
