We understand that there are times when you don't want to open up a chat, or take the time to call in.  There are times when simply searching for your question and getting that answer is the best method of support.  There are addition ways to receive an answer to your question before ever speaking to a Racker directly.

### The Support Drawer:

You can open the "Support Drawer" by logging in to the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel and clicking on "Support" in the header. The main benefit of the Support Drawer is its ability to search against all of our self-service content properties to help you get a quick answer to your question. The self-service content properties include the Knowledge Center, API Docs, and the Community.  This is the fastest (and simplest) way to find the information that you need.
Speaking of the Knowledge Center, API Docs and Community:
We like to use the metaphor of a car's owner manual when talking about the differences in these platforms.  

### The Knowledge Center

This is the owners manual.  It is fully vetted by our product team and is how each product should be used according to the manufacturer. Here you will find things like how to create a Cloud Server, how to configure a Cloud Load Balancer, and how to deploy a Wordpress configuration via Cloud Orchestrations.  This is by no means all of the content that is provided via the Knowledge Center.

### The API Docs  

This is likened to the engineer's manual or mechanic's guide.  It goes deeper than the owners manual and shows you some of the ways you can tweak the products to fit your needs using our APIs and SDKs. Using this information to have your applications work effectively with our APIs will make scaling your configuration much easier and let you spend less time on your configuration and more time on building your business.

### Rackspace Status Page:

The https://status.rackspace.com/  page is there to give you real time updates as to the status of our infrastructure.  If there are ever any infrastructure impacting issues you will be able to see what is impacted via the status page.  This page will also keep you informed of any maintenances that are occurring.   

### Features and Tools:

Cloud Orchestrations can help you configure your servers without you having to do all the manual work.  Of course, to get it working exactly as you need, you might have to install additional applications or tweak some configurations, but it takes a lot of the manual work away.  This frees you up to be able to work on your application and site, which you would prefer to be doing anyways. (Link to the thread on the most common orchestrations)
Cloud Monitoring allows you to set up checks and alerts for your site or servers.  This can alert you as to when the site is down or to when the server is having difficulties.  It also helps you find a place to start trouble shooting the site or server.  Configuring monitoring will give you a little piece of mind knowing that something is watching the site. (add in how Managed Ops responds to monitors and link to the service level description)
Cloud Feeds is a service that accepts and validates event notifications from other Rackspace Cloud services, and presents the data to you in a standardized way that is easy to interpret.  This tool can keep you informed of the activities on your account. (link to use cases)
How we can improve?
As with any business we can always improve.  We are always looking for ways to improve our support and our products.  The best way to let us know how we can improve is to use our https://feedback.rackspace.com/ page.  This page is monitored by leaders within our product and support segment.  If an idea starts to gain traction, they will start to look for ways that they can implement it in future product releases.
