We understand that some of our customers must sever their relationship with Rackspace for varying reasons. Before doing so, we encourage you to take extra precaution to ensure that you have properly migrated all data and services being used at Rackspace.

You can close your account at any time by using the following instructions:

1. Log in to your [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2. Delete all services such as servers, files, saved images, or backups by checking the box next to the services and clicking the highlighted **Delete** button.

3. Once you have deleted all services under the account, navigate to **Account Settings** and click the **Cancel My Account** link.

4. Follow the steps on the next page to complete the cancellation.

Your account is closed by Rackspace within 24 to 48 hours and a final invoice is generated on the next month's billing date.

**Important:** Your final invoice is non-refundable.
