Rackspace is the world’s #1 Managed Cloud Company. However, we didn’t get there by just focusing on providing support to servers. We have a wide reaching and robust portfolio that allows for our customers to create a solution unique to the needs of their business. Below, I am going to highlight a few of the common entry points that our customers use to start their journey with Rackspace.

 
### Website/Application Hosting Solutions

Managed Public Cloud is a great place to start for many businesses looking to bring their workload into the cloud. All of our hosting options in the public cloud are scalable and come with access to 24x7 Fanatical Support. There are multiple tiers of support to match your support need and budget.
