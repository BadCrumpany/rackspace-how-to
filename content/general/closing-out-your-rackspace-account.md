When that time comes and you no longer need hosting services with Rackspace, you can close out your account at any time by following these simple steps:
1. Please log into your control panel at https://mycloud.rackspace.com with your username and password
* If you remember your username but forgot your password, please use the “Forgot Password” link to reset. You will receive an email (one that is on file) with a link to reset the password.
* If you don’t remember your username & password, please contact us at 1-800-961-4454 so that we can verify you and provide you that information.

2 . Once you log in, please make sure to delete all services such as Servers, Files, Saved Images, Backups, etc
* Check on the check box to mark the services to delete. The Delete button will highlight for you to click on. 

3. After everything has been deleted, go to Account Settings and scroll to the bottom to locate the “Cancel My Account” link.

4. Follow the steps on the next page and Rackspace will close out the account within 24-48hrs and a final invoice will generate on the next month billing date. **This final invoice is non-refundable**
