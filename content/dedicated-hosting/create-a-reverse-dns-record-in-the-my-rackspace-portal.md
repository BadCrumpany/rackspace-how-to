Reverse Domain Name Service (RDNS) records are also known as Pointer (PTR) records. Typically, when you enter a domain name into your browser, the DNS system locates the IP address of the server hosting the domain. A Reverse DNS lookup does the opposite. It instead associates a domain to an IP address.

RDNS/PTR records are helpful for those running a mail server. Many recipient email servers check the sending IP address of the message, and if the Reverse DNS does not match the sending domain, messages may be rejected, or marked as spam. However, all email systems have different approaches to spam prevention, so this should not be considered a guarantee.

These steps will map your serverâ€™s IP address to a domain name.

### Create a reverse DNS record

1. Log in to the MyRackspace.com Portal.

2. Navigate to Network > Domains (DNS) > Actions > PTR Records (Reverse DNS).

3. Find the device IP address you would like to edit and click on the pencil icon on the right.

4. Enter the domain information for the selected IP address and click "Save Changes"
