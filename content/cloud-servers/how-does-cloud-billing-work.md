When using Rackspace Cloud products, you only pay for the services that you use.  This means that the bill you receive will be for services used in the previous month.  Your 30-day billing cycle begins on the day that you activate your account.  If you start to utilize our services in the middle of your billing cycle, your first bill will only be for a partial month but will still be presented on your scheduled bill date.  
One important fact to keep in mind is that your Cloud Servers and Cloud Load Balancers will be billed for up time as long as they remain in the 'Active' status â€“ even if they are not being actively utilized.  This is because we have allocated resources for your exclusive use which cannot be reserved by other customers.

**FAQ**

**So I pay for the time my cloud servers on are on my account, will I still be charged if my servers are suspended?**
According to Rackspace's terms of service, which can be found here: www.rackspace.com/.../legal, "If the suspension was based on your breach of your obligations under the Agreement, then we may continue to charge you the fees for the Services during the suspension".

**What about if my server goes down?  Do I still get charged for that?**
In the event that there is downtime for a server, Rackspace has a Service Level Agreement, which can be found here: www.rackspace.com/.../sla that explains when customers are entitled to credits.

**So how long is my contract in the Cloud?**
According to Rackspace's Terms of Service, "The initial term for each Order begins on the date we make the Services available for your use and continues for the period stated in the Order. If no period is stated in the Order, then the initial term shall be one month. Upon expiration of the initial term, the Order will automatically renew for successive renewal terms of one month each, unless and until one of us gives the other a written notice of non-renewal prior to the expiration of the initial term, or then-current renewal term, as applicable".  Basically, that's saying Cloud is month-to-month instead of locking you in for a long-term contract.

**What forms of payment does Rackspace accept for my cloud account?**
Rackspace accepts credit card payments on cloud accounts.  If you link your cloud account  to your dedicated hosting account, then the form of payment will be aligned with the form of payment on the dedicated account.

**What kind of credit cards does Rackspace accept?**
Rackspace accepts Visa, Master card, and American Express.

**How do I obtained an itemized bill?**
Within your Cloud Control Panel, navigate to **Your Account** and select **Billing**.  From here you will be able to review your Billing Overview for the current month as well as the Billing History for your Cloud account.  To review the Invoice details, select the link for your most current invoice and you can download your a PDF file of your invoice.
