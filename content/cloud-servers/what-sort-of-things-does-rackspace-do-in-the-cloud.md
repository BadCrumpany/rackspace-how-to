In Managed Cloud we have 3 different service levels that you can choose from.  We do have a high level comparison of the different service levels.  But what does this really mean we can do for you?  I'll talk a little about each service level. 
 

### Managed Infrastructure: 
 
This service level will give you 24x7x365 access to our Cloud Engineers.  You can speak to them via chat, phones or tickets.  These Engineers will be able to give you guidance, but they do NOT have the access to log into your servers directly.  If you are seeing an issue with your server/site they will be able to assist with ruling out the underlying hardware as being the cause.
 
This service level will also give you access to architecture advisors.  If you are expecting an increase in traffic and want some advice as to how to set up your environment please give them a call.  They are very familiar with the Cloud Products and will be able to give you guidance on how you should configure your environment.  
 
You will have access to launch assistance for the first 60 days.  This means you'll have a Launch Manager that you can reach out to directly to ask questions ranging from "How do I set up a new user for the Control Panel?" to "How should I configure my environment?".
 
Cloud Engineers are also available to provide you with security guidance.  As mentioned before, our Cloud Engineers won't be able to log into your servers to make changes, but they will be able to suggest ways of making the server more secure.  Locking down access to the server via firewall rules, for example. 
 
Finally, you will also have access to code development assistance.  If your code is leveraging our interfaces (API's, SDK's), we will be able to help you insure that it is accessing them correctly.  We won't be able to adjust your code, but if you are having difficulties using the API or the SDK's our Cloud Engineers are here to assist.  Please reach out to us so that we can help trouble shoot the cause if you are seeing an error when utilizing them.
 

### Managed SysOps:
 
Managed SysOps keeps the same basic pillars of support from Managed Infrastructure, but adds a deeper level of service.  This service level also will provide you 24x7x365 access to our Cloud Engineers.  You will be able to reach them via chat, phones or tickets.  The difference is, these Cloud Engineer WILL be able to access your servers.  If you are seeing an issue with the server/site they will be able to log into the machine and help pin point the cause.  If the cause turns out to be code related, they will not be able to adjust your code.  But at that point the issue would have been narrowed down and your developer can resolve it.  We have a list of operating systems and services that are supported in this service level for Linuxand Windows. 
 
In this service level you will have access to architecture advisors.  This will be in the form of Technical Account Managers which are assigned to your account.  They can work with you to ensure your success if you know of an upcoming event and would like guidance on configuring your environment.  They have a lot of familiarity with all the Cloud products and will be able to guide you in what would be the best configuration for your event.
 
You will have launch assistance available to you for the first 60 days.  A Technical Launch Manager that is assigned to your account during this period.  They will be your first person you will want to contact if you have any questions in regards to the account.  
 
You will have access to security guidance.  Our Cloud Engineer will be able to log into your server and give you suggestions on what could be modified for better security.  They will require your approval before making any changes.  
 
This service level offers code development assistance.  If your code is leveraging our interfaces (API's, SDK's) we will be able to help you insure that it is accessing them correctly.  Similar to the Managed Infrastructure service level, we won't be able to adjust your code, but the difference is we can log into the server and look at what you are doing.  We will be able to test things like, accessing the interfaces from your server, to insure that there isn't a problem with the access.  This will help narrow down the cause to being something code related.  At that point you'll want to utilize your developer for further assistance. 
 
At this service level, we will pre-install Cloud Backup on the servers and configure weekly backups of the standard system configuration files (file storage fees apply).  We will also restore, monitor and troubleshoot backup jobs.  We can assist with creating new backup jobs beside the standard ones if you have additional files or folders you would like backed up. 
 
Rackspace will be able to configure, monitor and troubleshoot common services for you, but we also configure, monitor and troubleshoot common services.  We will keep your server up to date with the latest patches and firmware updates.  These are configured to run automatically.
 
We can install and configure common web servers, app servers, databases and language frameworks for Linux and Windows.  For Linux this includes, but is not limited to, Apache, MySQL and PHP.  For Windows this includes, but is not limited to, IIS 7.5 and 8.0, MS SQL, and ASP.  We can configure the servers to serve website content and will assist with troubleshooting if something goes wrong with the site. 
 
We can configure monitor alerts to your specific needs and provide 24x7x365 response to the alarm conditions by our Cloud Engineers.  What this means is that if an alarm triggers at 2 AM on a Saturday morning, our Cloud Engineers will be here to take a look at the cause and find a resolution.  
 
As mentioned in the architecture assistance section, you will have a named Account Manager assigned to you.  This Account Manager will be your first point of contact for any account related question, billing questions, Control Panel questions or account guidance.
 

### DevOps Automation:
 
You will receive all the same services that are available in the Managed SysOps service level, but with some additional features.
 
You'll receive configuration management.  This will allow you to scale horizontally without a manual setup.  We can take your existing infrastructure (dev, staging and production) and automate it by using Chef or Microsoft Desired State Configuration.  This can provide you faster deployment to market for new features.  
 
This service level will give you Chef cookbook management.  This means that we can create, modify and maintain your cookbooks, but we will not take away the access from you.  You will still have access to the infrastructure code that powers and automates your infrastructure.  We will be here to assist when you need us. 
 
You will have on-demand scaling by utilizing configuration management.  This will help you if you have a planned or unplanned event.  You'll be able to scale your environment quickly to handle these needs. 
 
We will monitor your performance metrics using such tools as, New Relic, Cloud Monitoring and StatsD/Graphite.  This helps us to understand how your performance changes in response to code changes and other events.  Through these tools, we will have a quicker response time in case the code needs to be rolled back or modified.  We can also track critical business metrics, such as credit card processing times and signups.  This allows us to help pinpoint any slowness your customers may be experiencing. 
 
With this service level you will get log aggregation.  We will aggregate logs from all your devices and present them to you through the Kibana web front-end.  We can spot anomalies and patterns in product usage by simplifying analytics for millions of lines of logs.  We will be able to drill down and explain performance trends.
 
You will have 24x7x365 access to DevOps Engineers.  The engineers have expertise that comes from scaling some of the busiest and most complex web applications in the world.  You have access to them via phone, chat or tickets.  They will always be available to you to help answer any questions you have or to make adjustments in your configuration management.
 
You'll have access to a private GitHub repository.  This will give you full visibility into all of the code that powers your infrastructure.  Our DevOps Engineers will collaborate with you to make changes and will document and track every change made.  Along with the monitoring and log analytics we will be able to see any issues that stem from any of these changes.  Since it is tracked with every change, we will be able to roll back quickly to get you to a stable state. 
 

### In conclusion: 
This is actually just a fairly brief comparison of the differences between the service levels.  Each one has many many little things that differentiate them.  No service level is necessarily better than the other.  You'll need to base which level you choose, on your own business needs.  For a break down on the pricing for each service level you can play around with the pricing calculator.
