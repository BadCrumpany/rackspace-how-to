Problem: A licensing error is preventing you from accessing your Cloud Server via a Remote Desktop Connection.
Cause: By default, Rackspace Cloud Servers come with a Remote Desktop license that allows 2 concurrent users to access your server. If you need more than 2 users to be able to access the Cloud Server at the same time, you will need to purchase and install a Terminal Services license. You may have already installed a trial version of the Terminal Services license, and the grace period has recently expired, causing the recent appearance of licensing errors. 
Note: In Microsoft Windows &reg; Server 2008 this feature is named Terminal Services. In Windows Server 2008 R2 and 2012 R2 this feature is named Remote Desktop Services. 
Solution: Add Terminal Services or Remote Desktop licenses to your Cloud Server.
